So basically this is just a simple assistant.
The project structure is as it follows 
 root :
        actions: here we define the functions that the 
                system can perform
        Audio: the unit that allows your assistant to speak
        Dispatcher : here we make the connection between the actions and the key words that
                     trigger them 
        settings: some global variables defined 
        
 the assistant can do the following
 
 open any website : keywords open name_here
 search the web :  search what to be searched
 make a note:  take a note , make a note 
 get a space photo : space photo 
 system status : [default] system update 
 basic conversation module
 get a location : location place

Note: you can formulate the command how you want as long as 
    it contains the the trigger key words
